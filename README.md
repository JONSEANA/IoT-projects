**Smart Parcel Detector System**

---

## üìù Introduction

This project implements a **Smart Parcel Detector System** designed to secure packages delivered to residential addresses.  
It leverages the built-in sensors of the **M5StickC Plus** microcontroller to detect parcel presence and nearby human motion, enabling real-time monitoring and alerts.
A **Raspberry Pi** is also configured to host a local server to be accessed to see updated images captured.

## üß∞ Hardware & Software Prerequisites

### üîß Hardware

- **2√ó Raspberry Pi 4**
  - One acts as the **controller node**
  - One acts as an **NFS file server** (for remote storage of captured images)
- **1√ó Pi 4 Camera Module**
  - Captures images or video of delivery events
- **4√ó M5StickC Plus**
  - ESP32-based microcontrollers used for sensing and display
- **1√ó PIR Motion Sensor**
  - Detects motion to trigger camera capture and alerts

### üíª Software

- **Arduino IDE**
  - With the following libraries installed:
    - `M5StickCPlus.h`
    - `WiFi.h`
    - `WebServer.h`
    - Any relevant PIR sensor or button libraries

- **Python 3.10**
  - Required packages (install via pip):
    ```bash
    pip install flask opencv-python numpy requests
    ```

- **NFS (Network File System) Setup**
  - Configure one Raspberry Pi as the NFS **server**
  - Mount the shared filesystem on the **camera Pi** to enable centralized storage
